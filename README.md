ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m paiux
- I'm here because I admin some large servers and manage various bots, and I'm doing my best to fulfill our communities' needs.
- I am mostly writing CCs for YAGPDB. 
- I don't know any coding languages. :thumbsup: 

If you want to reach out for any reason, please find me on discord @paiux. 
You can join <a href="https://discord.gg/discord-developers">gg/discord-developers</a> to share a server with me.
