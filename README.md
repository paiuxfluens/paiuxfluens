- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paiuxfluens
I have no idea what I'm doing. :D I am only here because I am an admin for a large Discord server and we have certain needs that I am doing my best to fulfill.
I am mostly writing CCs for YAGPDB. 

I don't actually know any coding languages. :thumbsup: 

If you want to reach out for any reason, please feel free to find me on discord @paiuxfluens#0008. 
You can join discord.gg/ranboo to share a server with me.
